This Shiny App is for visualizing the density distributions of the survivors and non survivors of Titanic using the classic dataset found here <https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic>.

A logistic regression model was build and tested, the ROC curve and the density graphs help visualize the effect of the different thresholds for labeling a survivor in increasing or decreasing the false positives.
